Hi there!

I'm hoping this message reaches you. I'm not intending for you to merge this request, but I'm using it because I have no way of reaching you. 
I've actually been trying to reach you for quite some time now, but I just saw your fork of this repo, which gave me this chance to try it this wy.

### Even if you do nothing else with this, please give me some form of reply, either on hi@j45.nl or on github, so I at least know you have received my message. Thanks a lot in advance!

Now for the why: As you have probably noticed, I have a username quite similar to yours. I actually use jeroen45 as a username on a lot of other platforms. As your account didn't seem that active on Github, I was hoping we could work something out where I could get the jeroen45 username on github. It would really help fix some confusion people looking for my github profile have been experiencing. Now, I do understand that I'm asking for a lot here. If you're not interested in discussing this at all, please still let me know, so I can stop trying to reach you about it.

Thanks again,
Jeroen
